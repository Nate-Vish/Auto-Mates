## How to Use This File

This is your creative idea backlog. When you have ideas during sessions:

1. **Log them here** - Don't lose creative sparks
2. **Categorize** - Group by theme (UI, Features, Architecture, etc.)
3. **Date entries** - Track when ideas emerged
4. **Move when done** - Implemented ideas go to `Implemented_Ideas.md`
