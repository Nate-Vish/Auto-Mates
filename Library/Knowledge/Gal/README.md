## Browser UX Testing (Playwright CLI)
- [Playwright CLI Research](../../Dashboard/Work_Space/AwesomeMates/Studied/Playwright_CLI_Research.md) — Token-efficient UX testing via shell commands
- [Playwright MCP Research](../../Dashboard/Work_Space/AwesomeMates/Studied/Playwright_MCP_Research.md) — MCP alternative (reference only, we use CLI)
- **CLI Commands:** `playwright-cli open`, `playwright-cli snapshot`, `playwright-cli click`, `playwright-cli resize`, `playwright-cli screenshot`
- **When to use:** Test actual UX flows, verify responsiveness, check accessibility trees, document issues with screenshots
- **Why CLI over MCP:** 4x fewer tokens — snapshots are accessibility trees saved to disk, not pumped into context

- [WCAG Accessibility](../Sources/ux/wcag_accessibility_guidelines.md) — Contrast ratios, compliance
