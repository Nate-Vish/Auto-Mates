# AutoMates.AI Trademark Policy

## The Short Version
You can use our code (it's open source!), but you cannot use our **name** or **logo** in a way that makes people think your product is officially ours.

---

## 1. What is Covered?
This policy covers:
*   The name **"AutoMates"** and **"AutoMates.AI"**.
*   The AutoMates logo (robot/handshake icon).
*   The slogan **"Your AI Engineering Team in a Box"**.

## 2. Permitted Use (You don't need to ask)
You CAN use the marks to:
*   **Refer** to the project (e.g., "This tool is compatible with AutoMates").
*   **Discuss** the project in articles, blogs, or talks.
*   **Distribute** the software *unmodified* (keeping all original branding files).

## 3. Restricted Use (You MUST ask permission)
You CANNOT use the marks:
*   In the name of your own software (e.g., calling your fork "AutoMates Pro" is forbidden).
*   In a way that suggests **endorsement** or **affiliation** (e.g., "Official AutoMates Hosting").
*   As part of your company logo.

## 4. If You Fork This Project
If you create a modified version (a "fork") of this software and distribute it:
*   You **MUST** change the name so it is distinct (e.g., call it "RoboCoder", not "AutoMates-Red").
*   You **MUST** replace the branding/logos with your own.

*This ensures users know exactly who is responsible for the code they are running.*
