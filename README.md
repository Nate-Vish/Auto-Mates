# AutoMates.AI 🤖🤝
**Your AI Engineering Team in a Box.**

AutoMates is a role-based multi-agent framework that transforms Large Language Models into a structured engineering department. It moves beyond "chatting" with AI and introduces a professional **Plan → Build → Audit → Release** workflow.

## 🏗️ The Department
AutoMates organizes AI capabilities into specialized roles:

*   **📐 The Planner (Architect):** Translates your vision into technical blueprints and research requirements.
*   **🧠 The BrainStorm (Ideator):** Explores unconventional alternatives and solves creative blocks.
*   **🔨 The Builder (Engineer):** Implements the code strictly following the approved blueprints.
*   **🕵️ The Checker (Auditor):** Conducts rigorous code reviews, security checks, and logic validation.
*   **⚖️ The Legal (Compliance):** Ensures your project stays compliant with licenses and privacy laws.
*   **📦 The GitDude (Release Manager):** Manages version control and acts as a security guardian against data leaks.
*   **📚 The Fetcher (Librarian):** Scours the web to build the Agents' knowledge base for the project (`Library/Sources`).

## 🛠️ Key Innovation: The Study Phase
AutoMates doesn't guess. Before acting, Agents use the **Library/Sources** to learn professional lessons. The **Fetcher** ensures this library is stocked with the latest documentation, preventing hallucinations and ensuring code adheres to modern standards.

## 🛡️ Docker & Safety
We strongly recommend running each AutoMates project in its own **Docker container** to ensure isolation, safety, and a clean environment.

## 🔮 Coming to AutoMates v2.0
*   **The Orchestrator:** A master agent to manage the entire workflow automatically.
*   **Agent Factory:** An "Agent creating Agent" system to generate specialized teams (e.g., Game Dev vs. Web Dev) from templates.
*   **Recursive Delegation:** Agents hiring their own specialized sub-agents.
*   **Deep Agentic Memory:** Persistent context that evolves with your project.
*   **The Memorizer Agent:** A dedicated agent that synthesizes project history to draw healthy conclusions.
*   **Visual Context CLI:** Identity-aware terminal environments with role-specific color coding.
