# /watch-summary - Session Summary for Video Narration

Generate a concise, spoken-word summary of the latest chat session — formatted as a prompt for AI video/audio generation. Watch and hear your session instead of reading it.

## Usage

```
/watch-summary              # Summarize this session
/watch-summary <agent>      # Summarize from a specific agent's perspective
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify What Happened

Review the current conversation and extract:
- **Changes made** — files created, edited, deleted
- **Decisions** — what was chosen and why
- **Ideas discussed** — brainstormed but not yet implemented
- **Problems solved** — bugs fixed, blockers cleared
- **New tools/integrations** — anything added to the system
- **Status updates** — what moved forward, what's next

### Step 2: Write the Video Script

Create the summary at `Dashboard/Work_Space/Watch_Summaries/Summary_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[HH-MM].md`

Use this format:

```markdown
# Session Summary — [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Agent:** [who was active]
**Duration:** [approximate, based on conversation length]
**Generated:** [timestamp]

---

## Video Narration Script

[Write a natural, conversational narration script — as if briefing the user over coffee. Use short sentences. No jargon dumps. Speak in second person ("you", "your team"). Keep it under 2 minutes when read aloud (~300 words max).]

Structure the narration:
1. **Opening** (1-2 sentences) — What this session was about
2. **Key changes** (3-5 bullets narrated naturally) — What actually changed
3. **Decisions made** (if any) — What was decided and why
4. **What's next** (1-2 sentences) — Where things stand now

---

## Quick Reference

### Changes
| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| [change description] | [file/location] |

### Decisions
- [decision]: [reasoning]

### Ideas (Not Yet Implemented)
- [idea]

### Next Steps
- [next action]

*Generated by /watch-summary — paste the Video Narration Script into your AI video tool.*
```

### Step 3: Writing Rules

- **Conversational tone** — this will be spoken aloud, not read on screen
- **Second person** — "You integrated Playwright CLI" not "Playwright CLI was integrated"
- **No filler** — every sentence should carry information
- **~300 words max** for the narration script — aim for a 1-2 minute video
- **Be specific** — "updated 3 Knowledge files" not "made some updates"
- **Skip internal mechanics** — the user doesn't need to hear "I read Checkpoint.md then appended to Lessons.md"
- **Lead with impact** — what matters most comes first

### Step 4: Report

```
=== WATCH SUMMARY ===
Session: [date]
Agent:   [who was active]
Script:  Dashboard/Work_Space/Watch_Summaries/Summary_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[HH-MM].md
Words:   [~word count of narration]
Est:     [~minutes when read aloud]
=====================
```

Print the narration script directly in the chat as well, so the user can copy-paste immediately.

---
*Paste the narration script into any AI video/audio tool (NotebookLM, HeyGen, ElevenLabs, etc.) to generate your session recap.*
