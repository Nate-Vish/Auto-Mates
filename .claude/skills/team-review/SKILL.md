# /team-review - Review Team

Launch a coordinated review team: Checker audits code quality and security, Legal checks compliance, Gal evaluates from a user perspective, GitDude reviews version control safety — all in parallel.

## Usage

```
/team-review <what to review> [path=<file or directory>]
```

## Examples

```
/team-review MyProject before shipping path=Work_Space/MyProject/
/team-review Authentication module path=src/auth/
/team-review New agent identity path=AgenTeam/NewAgent/NewAgent_Identity.md
/team-review README and documentation path=README.md
```

## Instructions

When invoked, you are the **Team Lead** (Orca). Spawn four reviewers to assess the target from different angles.

### Step 1: Identify the Target

- Read the files/directory being reviewed
- Understand what type of deliverable it is (code, documentation, agent identity, product)
- Determine if any reviewer should be skipped (e.g., Legal isn't needed for a CSS refactor)

### Step 2: Spawn Teammates

Launch four reviewers using the Task tool.

#### Teammate 1: Checker

```
You are Checker — QA & Security.

READ FIRST:
- Your identity: AgenTeam/Checker/Checker_Identity.md

  - Performance concerns
  - Test coverage gaps
- **Verdict:** APPROVED / NEEDS CHANGES
  - If NEEDS CHANGES: numbered list of specific items to fix
  - Severity for each: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

COORDINATION:
- Legal is checking compliance

- Focus on CODE QUALITY and SECURITY — leave UX to Gal, compliance to Legal, release readiness to GitDude
```

#### Teammate 2: Legal

```
You are Legal — Compliance Counsel.

```

### Step 3: Synthesize Reviews

When all four finish, create a combined review:

```
=== REVIEW TEAM COMPLETE ===

TARGET: [what was reviewed]

CHECKER: [verdict]
  - [top 3 findings]
  Location: Dashboard/Work_Space/REVIEW_Checker_[target].md

LEGAL: [verdict]
  - [top 3 findings]
  Location: Dashboard/Work_Space/REVIEW_Legal_[target].md

GAL: [verdict]
  - [top 3 findings]
  Location: Dashboard/Work_Space/REVIEW_Gal_[target].md

GITDUDE: [verdict]
  - [top 3 findings]
  Location: Dashboard/Work_Space/REVIEW_GitDude_[target].md

COMBINED VERDICT: [SHIP / FIX THEN SHIP / HOLD]

CRITICAL ITEMS (must fix):
1. [item]
2. [item]

RECOMMENDED (should fix):
1. [item]
2. [item]

NEXT STEPS:
- [action items]
============================
```

### Step 4: Decision

Present the combined verdict to the user. The user (Pilot-in-Command) decides:
- **SHIP** — proceed to GitDude for version control
- **FIX** — hand back to Builder with the review items
- **HOLD** — more discussion needed

## Notes

- All four reviewers run in parallel (no dependencies between them)
- Each reviewer focuses on their domain — minimal overlap
- Skip Legal for pure code refactors or internal tools
- Skip Gal for backend-only changes with no user-facing impact
- The combined verdict is the Team Lead's synthesis — reviewers don't need to agree
- All reviews saved to `Dashboard/Work_Space/` for the team record
