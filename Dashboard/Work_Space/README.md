# Work Space

This folder is where agents do their work.

---

## What Goes Here

| File | Created By | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `BLUEPRINT.md` | Planner | Implementation plan for current task |
| `Status.md` | All agents | Current project status and progress |
| `*.md` | Various | Research notes, drafts, documentation |
| Source code | Builder | Code being developed |

---

## How It Works

1. **Planner** creates `BLUEPRINT.md` with the implementation plan
2. **Builder** reads the blueprint and implements code here
3. **Checker** reviews the code and provides feedback
4. **All agents** update `Status.md` with their progress

---

## File Ownership

- Agents create files here as needed
- User can read/edit anything
- Completed work may be moved to the main project folder

*This folder is your team's shared workspace. Keep it organized.*
